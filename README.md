## What is this?

It's a extension for [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) that provides syntax highlighting, code execution, and other features for Visual Studio Code.

I wish to make it a full-featured SageMath extension, especially for SageMath's LSP (Language Server Protocol) support. But obviously it'll be a hard work. Welcome to contribute and suggest!

## Features

-   Syntax highlighting for SageMath code
-   Basic Semantic highlighting for SageMath code (there are still some bugs, you can see [known bugs file](./readmes/SemanticHighlighting-en.md) for details)
-   Support F5, command and buttom to run SageMath file
-   Support hotkey for line comment and block comment
-   Support conda environment switching
-   Semantic highlighting rely on `perdefinition.py` for SageMath Std Library, you can modify this file to add more semantic highlighting support

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for details.

The extension **has released** on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace yet. You can install it from GitHub or the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
