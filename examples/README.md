# SageMath Examples

This directory contains example SageMath files to demonstrate the features of the SageMath for VScode extension.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `basic.sage` | Basic SageMath syntax examples |
| `crypto.sage` | Cryptography examples (useful for CTF) |
| `algebra.sage` | Algebraic computations and polynomial operations |

## Usage

1. Open any `.sage` file in VS Code with this extension installed
2. Notice the syntax highlighting and semantic highlighting
3. Press `F5` or click the play button to run the file

## Requirements

- SageMath installed and accessible via command line
- Conda environment configured (optional)

## Notes

These examples are designed to showcase:
- Syntax highlighting for SageMath-specific constructs
- Semantic highlighting for functions, classes, and variables
- Code execution capabilities
